## Additional Information
### About scan and the specimen

This is an average E15 mouse embryo generated through [ANTsPy template generation workflow](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerANTsPy) using 30 wild-type, mixed-sex, commercially acquired [C57BL/6J mice](https://www.jax.org/strain/000664). Original data was acquired at 9 micron, resampled to 18 micron for template building purposes. Segmentation was generated by Dr. Rachel Roston (SCRI). Atlas follows the anatomical terminology provided in Wong et al. A novel 3D mouse embryo atlas based on micro-CT. Development. 2012 Sep;139(17):3248-56. doi: 10.1242/dev.082016. Original specimens were collected in accordance with IACUC protocol 00030 (SCRI).
